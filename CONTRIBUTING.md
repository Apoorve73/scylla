# Contributing

### Hey there! I see you seek to contribute to this project and make it awesome. Scared? Don't worry we got stuff to do for you even if you learnt Python yesterday ;) So Read On...

I'll recommend reading [README.md](https://github.com/p014ri5/scylla/blob/master/README.md) first so you could get hang of what this project is about.

- To make a new command or contribute in other way first Fork this repo. 
- Next setup your own seperate Discord Bot. If you are not sure on how to do that you can watch [Discord Rewrite Tutorial by Lucas](https://youtu.be/nW8c7vT6Hl4) 1st video of this playlist.
- Next try implementing the command you are trying to create in your bot.
- Test it with different parameters, without parameters and implement error handling wherever necessary.
- Last add that stuff to code of the forked repo. Make sure that command goes to correct cog.
- Make sure that the decorator above command is `@commands.command` and not `@bot.command`.
- Then Add your name to README.md in the Contributions table.
- Then make a pull request :)

Can't wait to see what you guys could come up with.. 
Peace, Out âœŒðŸ”¥
